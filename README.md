## Goal  
The goal of this project is to classify leaves into their respective species using machine learning methods.  

## Description  
This project implements multiple machine learning approaches to classify leaf images into 99 different species. We explore traditional machine learning models, deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and ensemble methods to achieve the best classification accuracy.

## What's Included

### Data
- **Training data**: 990 samples with 192 features
- **Test data**: 594 samples with 192 features
- **Images**: 1584 leaf images (990 training + 594 test)

### Trained Models
- Decision Tree model
- Random Forest model (best performing traditional ML model)
- K-Nearest Neighbors model
